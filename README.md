Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application! This is a simple, interactive game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe against each other in a browser environment. Here's a brief overview of the application, its features, and how to use it.

About the Application
The Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application is a basic implementation of the classic game, where two players take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid. The goal is to get three of your markers (X or O) in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

How to Use
1. Open the Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application in your browser.
2. The game board will be displayed with empty cells.
3. Click on an empty cell to place your marker (either 'X' or 'O', depending on the current turn).
4. The application will automatically switch markers after each move.
5. Try to get three of your markers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to win the game.
6. If the game results in a draw, the application will notify you.
7. To start a new game, click the "Restart Game" button.
